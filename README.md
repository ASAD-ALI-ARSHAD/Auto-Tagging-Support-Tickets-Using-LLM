# Auto-Tagging-Support-Tickets-Using-LLM
This notebook compares zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned LLM approaches for tagging support tickets. It preprocesses text data, defines categories, implements each method, evaluates performance using precision, recall, and F1-score, and outputs the top 3 tags from the best method (few-shot in this case).
